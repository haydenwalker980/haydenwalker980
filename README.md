I'm Winfinity, someone who has way too much free time. 

# What I'm Working On
[**Bonfire**](https://github.com/BonfireProject/app), a Discord alternative written in Laravel.  
**Sorcery**, a GitHub clone that won't nickel and dime you for everything you own just to have the luxury of self hosting. Made by a small business owner who thought their GHES quote was fucking ridiculous. TBL, it's still in early development stages. 

## Stacks
main computer: Linux Mint  
Servers: They vary, but I host them all on Linode traditionally  
frameworks: PHP primarily
